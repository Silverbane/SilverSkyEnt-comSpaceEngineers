														Welcome to SilverSkyEnt.com a progressive survival server with a strong emphasis on economy, player interaction and PVE.
To join our Discord or Read about Updates Visit http://silverskyent.com for more information.
The Black Hole Edited mod causes you to stick to shipping lanes. If you go outside of these lanes you may die due to damage caused by the gravity of the black holes. Once you feel the gravity you have about 1.33km of distance before you start getting ripped apart. See the below for the locations of the gateways for safe travel.

NEW UPDATE: 08-15-2018 Black Holes added preparing for shipping lanes. Prices fixed for certain items in Economy. Safezone increased to 1000m. Low gravity added to RedMoon. More information can be found here https://github.com/Silverbane/SilverSkyEnt-comSpaceEngineers/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+updated%3A%3E%3D2018-08-15

RULES:
-1) No Griefing. The definition of Griefing is defined by the server admins and will be handled on a case by case basis. Use common sense. If you're here just to ruin everyones fun you will be banned.
-2) You must be in a faction. There is a faction called NEW you can join if you don't want to create your own.
-3) You must have an antenna or beacon on your ship or base set to 1KM or higher to prevent it from being raided while you are offline.
-4) No offline raiding. To raid a faction's base, simply check the faction tag on the antenna or beacon signal. Find out what the faction's full name is then hit F3 to check if someone from that faction is online. If someone from that faction is online you can raid their base or steal their ship. Basically, don't go near someones base if they're offline. Use common sense.
-5) No Tunneling player or NPC bases. (The act of attacking a base by digging under it then coming from below.)
-6) No building bases in protected shop space. It will be deleted. Also, bases within 5KM of a trade shop will not be restored if griefed. (The farther away from spawn you build your base the better.)
-7) We will put a safezone around player owned shops. You are not allowed to keep your personal items in the shop. If we find you using a playershop to keep your items safe we will delete said items with no warning.

										ice with your hand drill. There is an ice lake
										right next to the station. Once you have 
										collected the ice you can bring it back to our 
										store and sell it. To sell type
										/sell all ice
										or
										/sell # ice   - where # is the amount</p>
										
										<p>
										Open your helmet before you suffucate we 
										are on a planet with clean breathable air. 
										Press J. To your left you will see the 
										shipyard where you can find ships to 
										purchase with your credits. To check the 
										prices on a ship look at them and type
										/buyship

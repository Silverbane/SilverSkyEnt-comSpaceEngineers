														</header>
														<p>START TRANSMISSION --<br>
														There are reports coming in of small ongoing mercenary clashes on the planet surface. We have images from our men on the ground of entire STG factories ripped from the side of mountains. Nearby a Hunchback dropship was photographed crashed right in front of an STG fort. The trade wars seem to have begun in full swing. It is advised that all residents stay inside and away from any STG complex. The question now is when will it end, and will STG be able to survive this onslaught? <br>

															<h3><a href="#">News - Trade War Brewing</a></h3>
														</header>
														<p>START TRANSMISSION --<br>
														MA-I (Mahriane Industries) stock dropped significantly with the success of the STG (Independent Space Traders Guild) gamble. Their new upper stratosphere station dubbed Silversky Trade Depot has resulted in the STG to establish a powerful foot print in the free trade market out of the reach of MA-I large cargo freighters and mercs. The focus of the station was to create a line of trade with the small business surface dwellers while keeping the large freighters out which prevented the MA-I from controlling the market. 
														<br><br>
														Small factions have been happy with the steady prices and the security that this station has offered by its positioning. Though there have been several news articles regarding cargo ships crashing nearby due to the heavy gravity, netherless the station has weathered the storm. Not a single cargo ship was reported loss to mercenary or pirate interference which has spawned a new line of surface to space cargo ships.
														<br><br>
														The result of their success though has seen an increase in covert mercenary contracts for sabotaging the STG infrastructure in other areas on the surface. No one has claimed responsibility yet but STG is taking matters into their own hands and with their new found wealth they are increasing their own security by hiring mercenaries of their own. This build up might end up in a major conflict on the surface or in the near future.
